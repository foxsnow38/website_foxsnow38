I am an aspiring software engineer looking for a position in which to develop my skill
set. I have recently earned an associate of science degree in computer programming,
and I am excited to start working in the professional world. I believe that being a junior
front-end developer would help me with that goal, and I am also well-qualified for the
job.



In the last few months, I have been learning React. Before that, I wrote a Twitter bot
using the Puppeteer Node.js library and the Axios REST API. I have extensive experience
with HTML and CSS, and I am familiar with SQL and C#. Samples of my code may be
found on the linked Github page.



Through my previous work experience as a waiter and a salesman, I have developed
good social skills, and I am good at negotiation. As a former mechanic, I solve problems
methodically. I have changed my focus to software development because there is
always room for creativity and innovation in this field. For these reasons, I am
dedicated to improving my craft and eager to learn new skills.



Thank you for your consideration.
